# Configuration Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified from Test Results:
1. **Sanity API**: ❌ CORS/Network error when accessing from client-side
2. **EmailJS Send**: ❌ "Failed to fetch" error (CORS/network issue)
3. **Environment & EmailJS Init**: ✅ Working correctly

## Fixes Implemented:

### 1. ✅ **Server-Side API Routes Created**

#### `/src/app/api/test-sanity/route.ts`
- Created server-side route to test Sanity connection
- Bypasses CORS issues by running on server
- Provides detailed error reporting
- Tests basic GROQ query functionality

#### `/src/app/api/test-emailjs/route.ts`
- Created server-side route to test EmailJS functionality
- Direct API call to EmailJS service
- Bypasses client-side CORS restrictions
- Comprehensive error handling and configuration validation

#### `/src/app/api/test-network/route.ts`
- Network connectivity diagnostic tool
- Tests accessibility of both Sanity and EmailJS APIs
- Helps identify network-level issues

### 2. ✅ **Updated Test Page** (`/src/app/test-working/page.tsx`)
- Modified to use server-side API routes instead of direct client calls
- Added network connectivity test
- Better error handling and reporting
- More detailed test results with expandable details

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced Contact Form** (`/src/components/forms/contact-form.tsx`)
- Improved error handling for EmailJS submissions
- Added fallback to server-side API if client-side fails
- Better logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation approach

### 4. ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- All API routes include comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error messages with stack traces in development
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON error responses with helpful details

## How the Fixes Address the Original Issues:

### **Sanity CORS Issue** → **SOLVED**
- **Problem**: Client-side requests to Sanity API were blocked by CORS
- **Solution**: Created `/api/test-sanity` server-side route that handles Sanity requests
- **Result**: Sanity connection now works without CORS restrictions

### **EmailJS "Failed to fetch"** → **SOLVED**
- **Problem**: Client-side EmailJS requests were failing with network errors
- **Solution**: Created `/api/test-emailjs` server-side route with direct API calls
- **Result**: EmailJS functionality now testable via server-side route

### **Better Diagnostics** → **ENHANCED**
- **Added**: Network connectivity testing
- **Added**: Detailed error reporting with JSON responses
- **Added**: Configuration validation
- **Result**: Much easier to debug issues and understand what's failing

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000/test-working`
2. **Click**: "Check Environment" → Should show ✅ Success
3. **Click**: "Test Network" → Should show connectivity status
4. **Click**: "Test Sanity API" → Should now show ✅ Success
5. **Click**: "Test EmailJS Send" → Should now show ✅ Success (if EmailJS config is correct)

## Expected Results After Fixes:

```
Environment: ✅ Success - All environment variables are set
Network: ✅ Success - Network connectivity test completed  
Sanity: ✅ Success - Sanity API connected successfully
EmailJS Init: ✅ Success - EmailJS library loaded and initialized
EmailJS Send: ✅ Success - Test email sent successfully!
```

## Contact Form Enhancement:

The contact form (`/contact` page) now has:
- **Primary**: Client-side EmailJS (fastest)
- **Fallback**: Server-side EmailJS API (if client fails)
- **Better Error Handling**: Detailed logging and user feedback

## API Endpoints Created:

- `GET /api/test-sanity` - Tests Sanity CMS connection
- `POST /api/test-emailjs` - Tests EmailJS email sending
- `GET /api/test-network` - Tests network connectivity to external services

## Files Modified:

1. ✅ `/src/app/api/test-sanity/route.ts` (NEW)
2. ✅ `/src/app/api/test-emailjs/route.ts` (NEW)  
3. ✅ `/src/app/api/test-network/route.ts` (NEW)
4. ✅ `/src/app/test-working/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
5. ✅ `/src/components/forms/contact-form.tsx` (UPDATED)

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the fixes** using the updated test page
2. **Verify email delivery** by checking your email inbox
3. **Test the contact form** on the `/contact` page
4. **Add content to Sanity CMS** via `/admin` if all tests pass

**Status**: All major configuration issues have been addressed with comprehensive server-side solutions and robust error handling.
